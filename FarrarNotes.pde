Hey Mr.Farrar,
Other than my feature list, I have the following in this proj

FEATURE LIST:
different sphere visualization types
using rayleigh scattering to correctly predict what the water would look like (actually hard)
detail level
wrapping
my own vector classes
drawing biomes randomly
binary conversion
taking in any greyscale image (works with any)
water rises and falls
altitude scalar
controller


FEATURES (glitches) IM AWARE OF:
when scaling altitude, some quads change color before they r underwater (bc one vertex is underwater and it changes the whole quad)
sphereType doesnt do anything


IMPORTANT:
to test if random biomes work, Uncomment lines
