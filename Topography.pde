/* 

PROBLEMS:
WOOHOOOO THE GLOBE IS FULLY WORKING
NEXT STEPS:
    make a gui
    calculate the rain and temp stuff in generateSphere in sphere class
    how the hell do i map the temps of mars? (no way im doing it manually). Maybe the same way im gonna do biomes? (with triangle mapping?)

POSSIBLE OPTIMIZATION:
maybe import the graph and add triangles to match it, then send out ray to check if it hits


ADDITIONS:
calculating total amt of water on the planet at a certain water level(gallons)

ecology stuff:
gulfstreams and grasslands and beaches
adding something to auto detect range of colors from low to high (so i dont have to use grayscale)
CLIMATE:
https://www.jstor.org/stable/24975952?seq=5 go page 5 for graph of temps on mars
